						Outside of school and work, I volunteer at Longmont High School coaching the JV Softball Team. I have been a coach there for 2 years now and absolutely love it. Their seaosn is typically from the end of August (with the build up of summer workouts since May) to mid-end October, depending on if they make regionals or not. However, this season was a bit switched up due to coronavirus. So instead of a 10 week long season we had an 8 week long season. Which does not sound like a whole lot, but it truly made this season jam packed and fly by so quick. Coaching a high school sport during a pandemic was weird and not always the easiest but the girls worked hard and stayed healthy so us coaching staff is very greatful to have had a scuh successful season! 

						The past 2 years I've coached I have really grown to love it. In my future I hope I can continue to coach, especially at Longmont. Although it makes my life crazy busy for a bit, it is so worth it.

						Along with coaching I also play for the CU Club Softball Team where I am co-captiain for the second season in a row. I have been playing on the CU team for four years now. I joined the team first semester of my freshman year. When I first joined the club had a total of 11 girls (and 9 are needed to play). It was a pretty small team. Now, nearly 4 years later, we have more than doubled our amount of players. This semester it is hard to tell exactly how many we have at the moment because our season is delayed until next semester due to covid, but we are around 26 girls, which is outstanding!

						I love to hike. Especially hiking and exploring National Parks. There's something about being surrounded by such divine and intensely large beauty that is uncomparable. I have done many solo trips including Zion National Park and Canyonland National Park. As well as many with friends or family like The Grand Canyon, Black Canyon National Park, and Arches! I can't wait to do them all.
